For this event, Teen Girl Scientist Monthly sent a box of LPs across the pond! Each attendee got to take home a copy of the album, which ended up being really well received by the audience (completely unrelated to the free merch, we're sure).

Words chosen by the group to sum up the album included:

- excellent
- colliding
- spiky
- uplifting
- ambitious
- frameable
- nostalgic
- attention-to-detail
- energetic
- enthusiastic
