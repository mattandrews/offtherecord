cover_caption: "With a background in fine art, theatre and the febrile post punk scene, Rockman Rock and Kingboy D were experts in their own myth-making: They invented ambient house with Chill Out and Space, fired machine guns at The Brit Awards, and dropped dead livestock at the Turner Prize. And then there's something about a million quid. The pinnacle of their work together is this evenings record - The White Room, the hugely flawed soundtrack to a road movie that they might've nearly made"
