Off The Record is an experimental project by [Matt Andrews](http://mattandrews.info), a music-loving web developer. While it's far from the first event of its kind, we wanted to create something where people could make time for good music and hear people talk passionately about why it's great.

I moved from London to Birmingham in June 2015 and have restarted Off The Record in my new home city. I'm excited to see what the home of metal can bring to our little event, although we're unlikely to play any Sabbath (sorry, Ozzy).
